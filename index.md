## munea

Welcome to the munea.ml!

The "munea" is acronym of **mu**ltiplex **ne**tworks **a**nalysis. These three words describe our research project. 

The project consists of two parts:
* analysis of centrality measures in multiplex networks (for instance: in sensitivity context),
* classification of multiplex networks (for instance: using deep learning methods).
 
Our team is built from 2 Datalogy@[Faculty of Computer Science and Management](http://wiz.pwr.edu.pl/en/) students:
* Mateusz Gawe≈Ç
* Grzegorz Suszka

If you are interested in our progress and observations, you can visit our *GitHub* project page. There you can look at our multiplex networks exploration. Moreover, in our repository, you can find framework, authored and used by us in presented analysis.

Thank you for visit! :heart_eyes:
